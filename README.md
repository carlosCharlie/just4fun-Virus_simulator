A simple project developed only with hml, css Javascript and an SVG map.

To avoid making the simulation completely random, I have applied some rules that bring more realism:

<ul>
  <li>It is more likely to infect nearby areas.</li>
  <li>A more infected area has a greater effect on the rest of the areas.</li>
  <li>A larger area takes more time to become completely infected.</li>
  <li>A larger area has a greater effect on the rest of the areas.</li>
</ul>
